# 2/14/2026 9 PM - The beginning of my project!!  

_Time spent: 2.1h_  

When I finished my last **project**, I was thinking again about what I could do... I **thought** I'd try something **hard** and test my **nerves**... 💀
So I was looking and came up with this project - **_DEVBOARD_**!! I started to gradually make and create a **diagram**. When I had most of it done, I needed something to make my **DevBoard** special, to make it unique!
I stopped **thinking** and went to do something. I opened **KiCad** and started inserting all the components and connecting them **according** to the instructions. It went pretty **well**, but I got **stuck** on a few things for a while because I had never **encountered** them before.

# 2/14/2026 10:01 PM - Adding custom components  

_Time spent: 1.8h_  

I kept adding more and more **things** and I was slowly getting it **done**. But then I remembered that I wanted to add **something**! I decided to go for the **ICM-20602** and **SHT4x** first.
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-02-10 201901](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA0MTcxLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--8f91ccb51b20f87e2a1e6f4ece08eb8aaeeeb009/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-02-10%20201901.png)
So I put them in the program and started researching how to connect it... I've never worked with **them** before, so that was probably the **_hardest_** part for me so far. I also had to do some **research** on how these things are connected and I decided to connect the **ICM** via _I2C_!! I gradually started adding **resistors** and other things and after a long **time** I had it connected with all the **things** :)

# 2/14/2026 10:12 PM - Schema editing  

_Time spent: 1.4h_  

**Right** after adding the sensors I thought I would like to add **2 LEDs** for indication and **1 neopixel** that would be programmable via **GPIO25**! So I was looking for some components to make them small but powerful.
I decided on **WS2818B-2020** and normal **SMD LEDs**. I immediately prepared them and added them to the work surface. But I thought for a while how I could use the **LEDs** and what they would indicate. I told **myself** that it would be best if I chose this:
- **1st LED** - _POWER indicator_
- **2nd LED** - _RESET indicator_

So I started looking **again** how to connect them and it went pretty **quickly**, so I had time to redo a **few** **things**.

# 2/14/2026 10:19 PM - Pin assignment  

_Time spent: 0.6h_  

I was **thinking** about how I would make the pins on my **DevBoard**... So I started _experimenting_ and at first the pins didn't fit at all, so I started redoing it and said to myself that I'd **better** add another **3v3** on one side for some reason, because as I know **myself**, it will definitely come in handy in the future :)
So I already arranged the **pins** well and where there was space left, I put **GND**.

# 2/14/2026 10:29 PM - Editing a KiCad project  

_Time spent: 1.7h_  

Before I start assigning **cases**, I made parts of all the things so that I can **understand** them later and read the **schematic** better when, for example, I make a **PCB**.
I didn't know where to do it at all, so I had to look up where to make the **border** and then I **found** out that it's **normally** a _rectangle_... 🧑‍🦽
So it went pretty quickly, but I had to play **around** with it to get everything to **fit** so well.

# Assigning cases
As I wrote **earlier**, I started working on the cases. First, I marked all the same **capacitors** and gradually assigned them. I did the same with other **things**. It was the kind of thing that I didn't enjoy at all, but I had to do it **anyway** so that it would work **well** later.

# 2/14/2026 10:40 PM - Getting started with PCB design!  

_Time spent: 3.6h_  

After **checking** everything to make sure I wasn't missing **anything**, I ran the rules check test again and there were no **errors** that would jeopardize my project. So I could move on to the **PCB** itself.
I imported all the stuff and started connecting **everything**. I told myself several times that I would **never** be able to do it and **that** it would be terrible (_it happened_).
But I continued with the connections, which was really **difficult for me**.
**Several** times I had to delete several paths so that I could run **another** important wire and then re-draw the ones I had **deleted**. Well... it was very difficult, but I don't know how I **managed** to do it. I think I could do it even better next time, but for my **first PCB** that is difficult for me, I'm glad I connected **everything** at all.
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-02-13 151409](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA0MjE4LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--610d4386c1f125475d9b18e2422b7452da8e5a97/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-02-13%20151409.png)
  

# 2/14/2026 10:51 PM - Error correction  

_Time spent: 1.2h_  

I didn't think it would be **error-free** at all, so I immediately opened **DRC** and started redoing things that were badly connected, somewhere it touched the connections of some **components** to each other, but I **solved** that.
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-02-13 151652](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA0MjIzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--37f44e3aaffada6ef9074581d8fd04521597baab/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-02-13%20151652.png)
Unfortunately, **ICM-20602** was still annoying me and I didn't **know** why... So I did some research and found out that I had to modify **KiCad** so that it wouldn't be so **strict** with this component. So I **modified** it and then all that was left was to **pour** the board, with _copper_.
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-02-13 153254](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA0MjI0LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--de977ca282cfc5c252d8ff65a870d0ca5d6ddcaa/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-02-13%20153254.png)
  

# 2/15/2026 4:19 PM - Silkscreen creation  

_Time spent: 0.9h_  

When I was sure I **could** continue, I decided to go straight to **silkscreen**.
I created all the necessary things like:
- A **QR code** that has the URL to my GitHub project
- A name I chose "**PicoFlip X**" or PFX for short
- I also added my **nickname** at the bottom
- On the top I put **my** **own images** that I created and I wanted some smaller images:

![Snímek obrazovky 2026-02-13 215404](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA0ODA3LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--2f41a8da229d7b66cdfc9646cfa7261398ff0690/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-02-13%20215404.png)
# Silkscreen editing
So I continued importing the **images** and I also had to **resize** them somehow, so that took me a **while**. Then I had to put them on the **PCB** and play around with the **layout** and here is the bottom:
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-02-13 221942](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA0ODA5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--da59126d823ed60189ebf4bb98d7412f81f53815/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-02-13%20221942.png)
  

# 2/15/2026 4:44 PM - JLCPCB wants a lot of money from me...  

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

I started making **tables** and all the **exports** for the production of the **JLCPCB** board and when I was making tables, it was still quite good... Then I compressed all the files into a **.ZIP file** and uploaded it to the site. What I was **afraid** of came - they wanted me to choose a **_PCBA standard_**, because components like **neopixel**, **ICM** were only installed in the standard.
So I came across this huge problem of mine and said to myself that I would **redo it** rather than submit with about **100 dollars**.![Snímek obrazovky 2026-02-13 233512](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA0ODE5LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--09e3341ead9aa7f6313fdeddc2987f9f831f88c6/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-02-13%20233512.png)
  

# 2/15/2026 10:20 PM - Schema reworking   

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

So I had to choose some better **components** and I decided as **follows**: 
- Instead of **ICM** I will use **MPU 6050** 
- Instead of **WS2812B** I will use **SK6812**.
So I found the parts in **KiCad** and started to modify... But I still had to check if **JLCPCB** really assembles it in _economic_ **PCBA** - and it does, so I could **celebrate**!!!
![sn__mek_obrazovky_2026-02-14_133024](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA1MDY0LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--a921d2478ecc93ef447bfc1f20a381cdaa91832d/sn__mek_obrazovky_2026-02-14_133024.png)
  

# 2/15/2026 10:28 PM - PCB editing  

_Time spent: 1.6h_  

So I started connecting all the **components** together and it went pretty well, except for a **few** things where I had to **think** a **little** more.
Next I poured **copper** all over the board, but in some places the copper didn't pour properly, so I had to connect the **components** manually. This was more difficult for me, but I managed it.
So I continued with **silkscreen**, because in some places the components were placed differently and would **interfere** with it. I also rewrote the **LEDs** so that in the future I would know what each of them **indicates**. 
![image-1](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA1MDY2LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--d4c22be2f7b8f0bd04abc36acb4824fca1d1723f/image-1.png)
  

# 2/15/2026 10:51 PM - JLCPCB   

_Time spent: 1.9h_  

Right after everything I decided to **export** and create a spreadsheet for **JLCPCB**. First I had to remember where **everything** was and save it all in one **folder**. Then I continued with the production **files**, which I compressed into a **.ZIP** folder and I had this ready. 
I put everything on the website and had to edit everything manually, because **unfortunately** I had a _stupid table_. I also had to look for what parts to use for my components and that took me a lot of time. 
So I chose a **black PCB** and then I dealt with installing **2 minimal PCBs**! 
![sn__mek_obrazovky_2026-02-14_182733](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA1MDY4LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e699be1968b1433ad34b56723be97a79972963e0/sn__mek_obrazovky_2026-02-14_182733.png)

_So everything comes out to about **71 dollars**, even with **shipping**. Which is **very good**, considering the previous **price**!_
